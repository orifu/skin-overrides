# skin overrides

a simple mod for locally changing skins and capes. to do this, open up mod menu and press the configure button by the mod. from here, you can easily add skin or cape overrides by dragging and dropping or choosing from your library. to add to your library, drag and drop, add from an online player, or enter a username.

this mod needs [quilt loader](https://quiltmc.org/). if you're using fabric, you can switch over and keep all your mods!

this mod is client side only, meaning other people won't be able to see the changes you make. if you want to change your skin or cape, go to [minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net/), use the official launcher, or try a mod like [fabric tailor](https://modrinth.com/mod/g8w1NapE). this mod supports 1.20.3+. for 1.16.5 - 1.20.1, see [selfskin](https://modrinth.com/mod/kj7JLMnT).

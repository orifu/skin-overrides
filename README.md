# skin overrides

a simple mod for locally changing skins and capes!

overriding skins or capes is done from the overrides screen, which can be opened from mod menu or by pressing the key (defaults to O). from here, you can see your overrides, or add new ones. you can drag & drop an image, or pick from your library, which is a convenient place to store skins and capes.

this mod is client side only, meaning other people won't be able to see the changes you make. if you want to change your skin or cape, go to [minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net/), use the official launcher, or try a mod like [fabric tailor](https://modrinth.com/mod/g8w1NapE).

this mod supports every update since 1.18, with all versions since 1.19.4 having the ui. for a similar experience for 1.16.5 - 1.20.1, see [selfskin](https://modrinth.com/mod/kj7JLMnT). see [the compatibility page](https://lumity.dev/orifu/skin-overrides/wiki/compatibility) for more information.
